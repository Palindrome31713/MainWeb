  <p>Your voice is my favorite thing to hear, and your personality is my greatest inspiration. You have this magical way of making the whole world disappear until it’s just us. You aren't just my 'everything' you are the very best part of me.</p>

      <p>If I could give you one thing in life, I would give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes. Only then would you realize how truly beautiful and special you are to me.</p>

      <p>My love for you grows more every single day. Even on the quiet days when we’re doing nothing at all, being by your side is the greatest gift I could ever ask for.</p>

  <p>They say home is where the heart is, but I never understood that until I met you. You are my safe place in every storm. With you, I’m not just home I’m exactly where I’m meant to be.</p>
